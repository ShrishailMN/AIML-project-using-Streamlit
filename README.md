# World-Air-Quality-and-Water-Pollution-Visualization
Air Quality Data:
Columns:

Country: Represents the name of a country.
Year: Represents the year for which air quality data is recorded.
AirQualityIndex: Represents a randomly generated air quality index for each country and year. This index is an arbitrary numerical value reflecting the air quality level.
Description:

The dataset consists of 100 records with randomly generated air quality data for 20 different countries over the years 2010 to 2022.
The AirQualityIndex values are synthetic and do not represent real-world air quality measurements.
Water Pollution Data:
Columns:

Country: Represents the name of a country.
Year: Represents the year for which water pollution data is recorded.
WaterPollutionIndex: Represents a randomly generated water pollution index for each country and year. This index is an arbitrary numerical value reflecting the water pollution level.
Description:

The dataset consists of 100 records with randomly generated water pollution data for 20 different countries over the years 2010 to 2022.
The WaterPollutionIndex values are synthetic and do not represent real-world water pollution measurements.
Note:
These datasets are entirely fictional and generated for the purpose of creating a sample Streamlit app for data visualization.
